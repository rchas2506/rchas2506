 Hi, Names Ryan, a chap in his late 20's
 After 10+ years of non-stop gaming I dropped the addiction and started a new one. ✨Personal projects✨... What ever that means.
 I've got around 4 years of IT support experience, 0 years expierence in databases, 0 years in coding, 0 years in webdev, or any other techy thing you can think of. Wish me luck.
 I never even studied anything tech related... Anyway.
 So far, in order, I've build a HTML page, started working on a Starlight (Fork of astro) site, and a wordpress site (Ick). Gotta say, not very impressive yet. 
 I've done some other minor home lab style stuff, but nothing of note.


 If for any reason you want to reach out, go ahead: ryan.github@proton.me
 If anything ever ends up public on my repo, chances are it's just an open source project I've somehow figured out how to modify and feel proud of it.
 If it's not that, oops. Probably set a backup/version control repo public or posted my SSH keys again.

Does this profile readme page support mdx? cause damn my profile be ugly
