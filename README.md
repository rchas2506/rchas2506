Hi, Name's Ryan ðŸ‘‹
A chap in his late 20s.

After 10+ years of non-stop gaming, I dropped the addiction and started a new one: âœ¨Personal projectsâœ¨... whatever that means.

About Me
I've got around 4 years of IT support experience.
0 years of experience in databases, coding, web development, or any other techy thing you can think of.
I never even studied anything tech-related... Anyway, wish me luck.
What I've Done So Far
Built a basic HTML page.
Started working on a Starlight (fork of Astro) site.
Created a WordPress site (ick).
Gotta say, not very impressive yet. I've done some other minor homelab-style stuff, but nothing of note.

If You Want to Reach Out

A Disclaimer
If anything ever ends up public in my repos, chances are:

It's an open-source project I've somehow figured out how to modify and feel proud of.
Or... oops, I probably set a backup/version control repo public or posted my SSH keys again.
