# Hi, Name's Ryan ðŸ‘‹  
A chap in his late 20s.  

After wasting many years playing video games, I dropped the addiction and started a new one: âœ¨**Personal projects**âœ¨... whatever that means.

## About Me  
- I've got around 4 years of IT support experience.  
- **0 years** of experience in databases, coding, web development, or any other techy thing you can think of.  
- I never even studied anything tech-related... Anyway, wish me luck.

## What I've Done So Far In Time Order  
1. Built a basic HTML page.  
2. Started working on a **Documentation** site, powered by Astro.  
3. Created a WordPress site (ick).
4. Created an AD for GitHub Education. It's live right now if you want to see it @ rhvn.org 

Gotta say, not very impressive yet. I've done some other minor homelab-style stuff, but nothing of note.

## Disclaimer  
If anything ever ends up public in my repos, chances are:  
- It's an open-source project I've somehow figured out how to modify enough to feel cool about it.  
- I've probably set a backup/version control repo public
- Accidently posted my private SSH keys again
